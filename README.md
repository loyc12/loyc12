### Hello there!

I'm alumni of 42 Qu√©bec, and you can find most of my personal projects here, including multiple game engine attemps.

You can also find many of my school projects here as repos ( although currently they aren't exactly meant to be seen or used by non-students, so sorry in advance if the presentation isn't exactly the best... ).

Btw, I'm currently looking for employment, in case you have any opportunities for me.
