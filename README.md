### Hello there!

I'm currently a student at 42 Qu√©bec, and thus you can find many of my school projects here as repo (although currently they aren√àt exactly meant to be seen or used by non-students, so sorry if the presentation isn't exactly the best...). I also have a few repos for personal projects (the biggest of which is currently Clonecraft). I'm currently focused on learning C++ and C#, and I'm pretty good with C all things considered.
